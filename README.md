# AM4LGAM8 - Ludum Dare #54

> AMALGAMATE (Intransitive verb) : To combine into a unified or integrated whole

A game made in 48 hours for the [Ludum Dare](ldjam.com) Game Jam using Rust+Bevy. The theme was "Limited Space".

AM4LGAM8 is a simple Puzzle-game, and a tribute to 2048 (hence the numbers in the name). The goal is to score as many points as possible by exploding tiles using bombs.
As you have very limited space, you can combine tiles so that they take up less space. Combining bombs together will explode the tiles and add their value to your score.

The game ends when you have no possible moves.
